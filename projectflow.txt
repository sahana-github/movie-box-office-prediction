Step-by-Step Project Flow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather raw data (e.g., movies dataset) and place it in the `data/` folder.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use `data_processing.py` to clean and preprocess the data:
     - Handle missing values.
     - Feature engineering.
     - Split data into training and testing sets.
   
3. **Model Training**:
   - Run `main.py` to train multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.):
     - Load preprocessed data.
     - Train different models using `train_model`.
     - Log training results (parameters, metrics) using **MLflow**.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate each modelâ€™s performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and log the results.

5. **MLflow Tracking**:
   - Start the **MLflow UI** with `mlflow ui`.
   - Monitor models, metrics, and parameters at `http://localhost:5000`.

6. **Optional: Airflow Automation**:
   - Set up **Apache Airflow** to schedule and automate model training.
   - Use Airflow to create DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for workflows.

7. **Optional: Version Control & CI/CD**:
   - Use **DVC** (Data Version Control) to manage datasets and model versions.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated testing and deployment.

### Optional Tools & Enhancements

- **Docker**: For containerizing the project.
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking and model management.

This flow keeps the project simple, from data collection to model deployment, with optional automation and version control.
